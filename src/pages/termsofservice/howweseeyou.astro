  <h1 style="font-size: 1.875rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Terms of Service</h1>
  
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    Welcome to How We See You! These terms of service outline the rules and regulations for the use of TryAgain's How We See You application. By accessing or using our application, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree with any part of the terms, you may not access the application.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    How We See You is designed as an interactive social game where players are presented with scenarios and must write creative responses imagining what other players would do in those situations. Other participants then vote for their favorite responses. The app includes a repository of pre-defined scenarios and allows users to create custom scenarios. The nature of the game may result in mature content depending on the users playing.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    Due to the potential for mature content in user-generated responses:
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>How We See You is recommended for users aged 17 and above.</li>
      <li>Users under the age of 17 should have parental permission and supervision when using the app.</li>
