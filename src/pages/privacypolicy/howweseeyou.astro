    The information we collect is used to:
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>Provide and maintain the app functionality, including room creation and real-time updates.</li>
      <li>Present player-provided responses to other players in the game room.</li>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">3. User-Generated Content</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    How We See You allows users to provide their own content in the form of creative responses to scenarios. The app also includes a custom zone where users can create their own scenarios:
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>Content provided by users is their responsibility and should comply with our community guidelines.</li>
      <li>We do not actively monitor or moderate user-generated content in custom zones or creative responses.</li>
      <li>User-generated content may contain mature language or themes depending on the players in a given room.</li>
      <li>User-generated content is stored temporarily and shared only with other players in the same room.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates our terms of service if reported.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">4. Scenario Repository</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    The app includes a repository of pre-defined scenarios:
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>These scenarios are designed for entertainment purposes only.</li>
      <li>The repository is regularly updated to enhance the gaming experience.</li>
      <li>Users can also create and share their own custom scenarios.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee that all user-created scenarios will be appropriate for all audiences.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">5. Content Language and Maturity</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    Due to the creative nature of the game:
    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      <li>The language and content in user responses may vary in maturity level.</li>
      <li>The appropriateness of content depends entirely on the players in each room.</li>
      <li>We recommend that players establish their own content guidelines within each room.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for the nature or appropriateness of user-generated content.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">6. Data Security</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. All data is stored securely in Firebase with appropriate access controls and encryption. Room data, scenarios, and player responses are temporary and automatically deleted after the expiration period (typically after game completion).
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">7. Third-Party Services</h2>
